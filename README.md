# SVMs-Classifying-Families-Genus-and-Species-of-Frogs
This machine learning project:  
• Trained a set of support vector machines (SVMs) to classify the family, genus, and species of frogs with 22 Mel- frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) of their calls.  
• Obtained the best cross-validated SVMs with a test hamming score of 0.99 using the binary relevance approach, Gaussian kernels and L2-penalty.

This project is Homework 7 for the course DSCI552 Machine Learning for Data Science. The dataset came from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/406/anuran+calls+mfccs.
